#Univariate Analysis
#1. Question: What is the distribution of log-transformed weekly sales?
  
#  Visualization: Histogram of Log-transformed Weekly Sales

# Histogram of Log-transformed Weekly Sales
ggplot(Walmart_sales, aes(x = log(Weekly_Sales))) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Log-transformed Weekly Sales",
       x = "Log(Weekly Sales)",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

#Insight:
  
#  The histogram of log-transformed weekly sales provides a clearer view of the distribution compared to the original exponential scale.

```
```{r}
#Bivariate Analysis
#2. Question: How do log-transformed weekly sales vary with holidays?
  
#  Visualization: Boxplot of Log-transformed Weekly Sales by Holiday Flag

# Boxplot of Log-transformed Weekly Sales by Holiday Flag
ggplot(Walmart_sales, aes(x = factor(Holiday_Flag), y = log(Weekly_Sales), fill = factor(Holiday_Flag))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Log-transformed Weekly Sales by Holiday Flag",
       x = "Holiday Flag",
       y = "Log(Weekly Sales)",
       fill = "Holiday Flag") +
  theme_minimal()

#Insight:
  
#  This boxplot shows the distribution of log-transformed weekly sales by holiday flag. We can observe differences in sales distribution between weeks with and without holidays.
```
```{r}
#Multivariate Analysis
#3. Question: How do log-transformed weekly sales relate to temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate?
  
#  Visualization: Scatterplot Matrix of Log-transformed Weekly Sales and Other Variables

# Scatterplot Matrix of Log-transformed Weekly Sales and Other Variables
ggpairs(Walmart_sales[, c("Weekly_Sales", "Temperature", "Fuel_Price", "CPI", "Unemployment")]) +
  theme_minimal()

#Insight:
  
#  The scatterplot matrix allows us to explore the relationships between log-transformed weekly sales and other variables, helping to identify potential correlations or patterns.
```
```{r}
#Multivariate Analysis
#4. Question: Is there a difference in weekly sales trends across different stores?
  
#  Visualization: Line Plot of Log-transformed Weekly Sales by Store

# Line Plot of Log-transformed Weekly Sales by Store
ggplot(Walmart_sales, aes(x = as.Date(Date, "%d-%m-%Y"), y = log(Weekly_Sales), color = factor(Store))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Log-transformed Weekly Sales Trends by Store",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Log(Weekly Sales)",
       color = "Store")

#Insight:
  
#  This line plot illustrates the log-transformed weekly sales trends across different stores over time, providing insights into variations in sales performance among stores.
#By applying log transformation to the weekly sales variable, we can better handle its exponential nature and conduct meaningful exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset more effectively.
